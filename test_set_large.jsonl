The form moother (with spelling reflecting the original long vowel although it may well have been shortened in pronunciation) persists in standard English into the 17th cent.\nIn Old English the genitive singular normally coincided in form with the nominative mōdor (in some Anglian and late West Saxon texts forms showing extension of the mutated vowel from the dative singular are also attested). The unmarked genitive continues to occur commonly in Middle English. Genitive compounds before the 15th cent. are always found with the first element unmarked. Some early genitive compounds with the unmarked form survive to the present day, although no longer clearly apprehended as such (e.g. mother tongue n., mother wit n.). The analogical genitive in ‑s is attested early (compare Old English (Northumbrian) genitive forms mōderes, mōdres from the second half of the 10th cent. in the Lindisfarne Gospels), and had become standard (outside genitive compounds) by the end of the Middle English period.\nIn Mother of God at sense I.2a after post-classical Latin mater Dei (5th cent., in turn after Hellenistic Greek Θεοτόκος).
