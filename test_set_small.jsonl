A strong masculine plural cǣgas is also once attested in Northumbrian.\nThe stem vowel apparently shows i-mutation of early Old English long ā caused by the inflectional suffix, which perhaps followed immediately after the stem vowel. In that case, g in the Old English word would be the graphic representation of the semivowel of the suffix, preserved after a vowel (and the word perhaps shows the reflex of West Germanic doubled *jj). Alternatively, g could represent a palatalized velar, later vocalized in Middle English. As the subsequent phonological development in English would be the same in either case (and similarly in Frisian), the question is not resolvable with certainty in the face of the disputed etymology.\nThe normal southern Middle English development of this word showed a diphthong, which would normally give /keɪ/ in modern English. The diphthong is shown regularly in rhymes in Middle English verse, and can be found also in rhymes in early modern English; for instance key is rhymed with way several times even in late works by Dryden from the end of the 17th cent.\nThe modern pronunciation of the word with /iː/ apparently reflects what was originally a northern form, probably the reflex of a form with intervocalic (as opposed to word-final) /j/ , in which no diphthong was developed prior to loss of the semivowel, and which hence showed either Middle English long open or long close ē. Pronunciations with the reflex of Middle English long open ē are shown by some orthoepists from the mid 17th cent. Compare similarly lea n.2, and compare also discussion at quay n. See further E. J. Dobson Eng. Pronunc. 1500–1700 (ed. 2, 1968) vol. II. §129, A. J. Aitken & C. Macafee Older Sc. Vowels (2002) §6.3.2.\nSpecific sense developments\nIn biological use in sense A.II.5e after post-classical Latin clavis, specific use (e.g. Linnaeus Systema Naturæ (ed. 6, 1748) 78) of classical Latin clāvis key (see clavis n.).\nWith sense A.III.10a compare post-classical Latin use of classical Latin clāvis to denote the keystone or boss at the intersection of the ribs in vaulting (from 12th cent. in British sources).\nIn sense A.III.11 apparently resulting from confusion of classical Latin clāvus tiller, rudder (see clavus n.) with clāvis key (see clavis n.).\nIn musical use in sense A.IV.17a after corresponding use (in post-classical Latin, from the 12th cent.) of classical Latin clāvis (see clavis n.). Sense A.IV.17b seems to be an extension in English of sense A.IV.17a and is apparently not paralleled in Latin. Compare clef n.1 In sense A.V.19a after corresponding use (in post-classical Latin) of classical Latin clāvis (from the 14th cent. or possibly the 13th cent. denoting the keys of a keyboard instrument); compare the use of classical Latin clāvis in the name of the clavichord (see clavichord n. and foreign-language forms cited at that entry); compare also Middle French, French clavier denoting the keyboard of a keyboard instrument (1564; compare clavier n.). With sense A.V.19b compare French clef, Italian chiave, which both occur denoting the keys of a wind instrument (as well as in sense A.III.14a and the sense ‘clef’: see clef n.1), but not the keys of a keyboard instrument. German Schlüssel ‘key’ is occasionally found denoting the keys of a keyboard instrument (beside more usual Taste), but apparently only later than in English (18th cent.).\nAttempts to explain the further etymology\nA summary of attempts to explain the further etymology is given by A. Liberman Analyt. Dict. Eng. Etymol. (2008) at cited word, together with a further hypothesis.\nOccurrence in place names\nThe word apparently also occurs early as a place-name element; however, its meaning is uncertain and disputed (compare discussion in Vocab. Eng. Place-names at cǣg). For place names such as Kaibal, Lancashire (a1210; now Cabus) a meaning ‘peg’ has been suggested (compare sense A.III.12a), but it is now more commonly assumed that the place-name element denotes a particular shape of hill-spur.
